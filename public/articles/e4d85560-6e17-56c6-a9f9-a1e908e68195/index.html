				<h2>फावड़े वाले व्यक्ति ने तीन वृद्ध परिवार के सदस्यों की हत्या की</h2>
				<p class="date">2025-02-28T14:56:00+00:00</p>
				<p class="summary">24 वर्षीय राम दयाल, जो मानसिक बीमारी से पीड़ित होने का संदेह है, ने शुक्रवार को गोरखपुर के झंघा में एक फावड़े से तीन बुजुर्ग परिवार के सदस्यों की हत्या कर दी। मृतकों में उसके दादा कुबेर मौर्या, दादी द्रौपदी और ताऊ साधु मौर्या शामिल थे।<br>पुलिस के अनुसार, दयाल ने फावड़े से एक भैंस पर हमला किया, और जब उसके दादा ने हस्तक्षेप किया, तो उसने उन पर और उनकी दादी और ताऊ पर जानलेवा हमला कर दिया, जो उनकी मदद के लिए आए थे। स्थानीय लोगों ने दयाल को पकड़ लिया और फावड़ा बरामद कर लिया गया।<br>पुलिस को लगता है कि दयाल की मानसिक अस्थिरता इस घटना का कारण है, जिसमें उसके अतीत में हिंसक व्यवहार का इतिहास शामिल है, जिसमें दो दिन पहले एक तेज हथियार का प्रदर्शन भी शामिल है। परिवार के इतिहास में मानसिक स्वास्थ्य समस्याएं हैं, जिसमें मृतक कुबेर को अतीत में मनोचिकित्सा देखभाल मिली थी।</p>
