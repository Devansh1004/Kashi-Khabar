				<h2>वडोदरा में शराब पीकर गाड़ी चलाने से हुई दुर्घटना में महिला की मौत</h2>
				<p class="date">2025-03-14T06:09:00+00:00</p>
				<p class="summary">वडोदरा में, 23 वर्षीय कानून के छात्र रक्षित चौरसिया ने कथित तौर पर नशे में धुत होकर अपनी कार तीन वाहनों से टकरा दी, जिससे हेमाली पटेल की मौत हो गई और आठ अन्य लोग घायल हो गए। चौरसिया कार चला रहे थे, जबकि उनके दोस्त मीत चौहान कार के मालिक थे। दोनों पर लापरवाह हत्या का आरोप है। चौरसिया के रक्त के नमूनों ने नशे में होने की पुष्टि की। <br>यह घटना तब हुई जब चौरसिया की कार ने एक दोपहिया वाहन पर एक महिला और दो अन्य बाइकर्स को टक्कर मारी। दुर्घटना के बाद चौरसिया ने "एक और राउंड" और "चाचा" चिल्लाया, जिसके कारण स्थानीय लोगों ने पुलिस के आने से पहले उन्हें दौड़ाया और पीटा। यात्री के रूप में चौहान ने दावा किया कि चौरसिया कार चला रहे थे। चौहान के रक्त के नमूने भी लिए गए थे। पुलिस मामले की आगे जांच कर रही है।</p>
