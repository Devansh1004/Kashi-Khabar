				<h2>परिवार का नरसंहार: मानसिक रूप से अस्थिर व्यक्ति ने किया हमला</h2>
				<p class="date">2025-02-28T14:56:00+00:00</p>
				<p class="summary">एक २४ वर्षीय व्यक्ति, जिसकी पहचान राम दयाल के रूप में हुई है, ने शुक्रवार की सुबह झंखा, गोरखपुर में अपने परिवार के तीन सदस्यों को एक फावड़े से कथित तौर पर मार डाला। मृतकों में उनके दादा कुबेर मौर्या, दादी द्रौपदी और चाचा साधु मौर्या शामिल थे। <br>पुलिस को संदेह है कि राम दयाल मानसिक रूप से अस्थिर था और उसका आक्रामक व्यवहार का इतिहास रहा है। घटना से दो दिन पहले, उसने गाँव में एक तेज़ हथियार का प्रदर्शन किया, जिससे अफरातफरी मच गई। उसकी माँ ने बताया कि एक हालिया दुर्घटना के बाद से वह अजीब व्यवहार कर रहा था। <br>राम दयाल को घटनास्थल पर गिरफ्तार किया गया और हत्या का हथियार बरामद किया गया। परिवार के पास मानसिक स्वास्थ्य समस्याओं का दस्तावेजी इतिहास है। <br>मृतकों के शव का पोस्टमॉर्टम किया जा रहा है और फोरेंसिक विश्लेषण किया जाएगा।</p>
