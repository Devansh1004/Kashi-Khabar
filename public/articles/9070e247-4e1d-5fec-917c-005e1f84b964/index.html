				<h2>होली त्रासदी: पूर्व प्रेमी का बदला लेने से जान गई।</h2>
				<p class="date">2025-03-15T20:05:00+00:00</p>
				<p class="summary">एक २४ वर्षीय व्यक्ति, सुनील कुमार, को शुक्रवार की रात वाराणसी के डीएवी कॉलेज के पास अपने आवास के बाहर गोली मारकर हत्या कर दी गई। यह घटना तब हुई जब सुनील होली के जश्न से घर लौटे और अपने गेट पर खड़े थे तभी बाइक सवार हमलावरों ने उनसे संपर्क किया। एक तर्क-वितर्क हुआ, और हमलावरों में से एक ने सुनील को गोली मार दी, जिसे बाद में बीएचयू ट्रामा सेंटर में मृत घोषित कर दिया गया। <br>पुलिस सुनील की पूर्व प्रेमिका के वर्तमान प्रेमी को आरोपी मानती है, यह आरोप लगाते हुए कि सुनील ने अपनी पूर्व प्रेमिका से संपर्क करना जारी रखा, जो उनके ब्रेकअप के बावजूद उनकी पूर्व प्रेमिका के प्रेमी को गुस्सा दिलाता था। <br>अज्ञात हत्यारों के खिलाफ मामला दर्ज किया गया है, और आरोपी को पकड़ने के लिए पुलिस जांच जारी है। सुनील के परिवार और पड़ोसियों ने शनिवार को उनकी हत्या के विरोध में कॉलेज सड़क को अवरुद्ध कर दिया, न्याय की मांग की। अधिकारियों ने उन्हें त्वरित कार्रवाई का आश्वासन दिया, और बाद में विरोध प्रदर्शन बुलाया गया।</p>
