				<p class="summary">वराणसी की नैना कुशवाहा के खिलाफ एक चार साल के पड़ोसी के बच्चे को उनके कुत्ते द्वारा काटने के बाद दुर्भावनापूर्ण धमकी, लापरवाह व्यवहार और जीवन को खतरे में डालने का मामला दर्ज किया गया था। यह घटना 7 मार्च को तब हुई जब बच्चा बाहर खेल रहा था। <br>पीड़ित की माँ ने आरोप लगाया कि नैना ने अपने कुत्ते को संभालने में लापरवाही बरती थी, जिसे उसने एक महीने पहले दिल्ली से लाया था। उसने यह भी दावा किया कि नैना ने अपने बच्चे को कुत्ते के काटने के बारे में उससे सामना करने के बाद उसे गंभीर परिणामों के साथ धमकी दी थी। <br>माँ की शिकायत के आधार पर, नैना के खिलाफ बीएनएस अधिनियम की धारा 291, 125(ए), 352 और 351(3) के तहत एक नामित प्राथमिकी दर्ज की गई थी। पुलिस वर्तमान में इस मामले की जांच कर रही है।</p>
