				<p class="summary">दूध व्यापारी राजेश यादव (50) की परियावा गांव, जौनपुर जिले में सोमवार रात को क्रूरता से हत्या कर दी गई। स्थानीय युवक राहुल यादव (25) को गिरफ्तार किया गया और उसने अपराध स्वीकार करते हुए बताया कि उसका उद्देश्य राजेश की मृतक बेटी से शादी करने के प्रयास में अस्वीकृति का बदला था। <br>राजेश, एक सक्रिय समाजवादी पार्टी कार्यकर्ता, गांव के टेलीफोन एक्सचेंज के पास गला काटकर मृत पाया गया। इस घटना ने गांव में तनाव फैला दिया, जिससे सावधानी के तौर पर भारी पुलिस तैनाती की गई। <br>पुलिस ने राजेश के शव को पोस्टमार्टम के बाद गांव में लौटाने से पहले राहुल को गिरफ्तार कर लिया। वरिष्ठ अधिकारी, एसपी सहित, ग्रामीणों को शांत करने और उन्हें त्वरित जांच का आश्वासन देने के लिए हस्तक्षेप किया।</p>
