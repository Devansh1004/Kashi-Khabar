				<p class="summary">उत्तर प्रदेश के बलिया जिले में ३० वर्षीय पशुपालक अवधेश कुमार की उनके पड़ोसियों के साथ उनके बकरे द्वारा अनाज खाने को लेकर हुई झड़प के बाद पीट-पीटकर हत्या कर दी गई। यह घटना सिंघपुर गांव में हुई जब कुमार अपने पड़ोसी के घर से अपने बकरे को वापस लेने गया, जो वहां घुसकर अनाज खाने लगा था। <br>इसके बाद बहस हुई, जो पड़ोसी परिवार के दो किशोर लड़कों द्वारा शारीरिक हमले में बदल गई। कुमार को खेत में बुरी तरह पीटा गया, जिससे वह बेहोश हो गया। उन्हें जिला अस्पताल ले जाया गया, लेकिन वहां पहुंचने पर उन्हें मृत घोषित कर दिया गया। पुलिस ने हमले में इस्तेमाल की गई लकड़ियों को बरामद कर लिया है और आरोपी किशोरों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया है, जिन्हें बाल न्याय बोर्ड के सामने पेश किया गया।</p>
