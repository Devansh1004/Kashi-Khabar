				<h2>दादा, दादी, चाचा की परिवारिक त्रासदी में हत्या</h2>
				<p class="date">2025-02-28T14:56:00+00:00</p>
				<p class="summary">२४ वर्षीय राम दयाल, जो मानसिक रोग से पीड़ित होने का संदेह है, ने शुक्रवार को जंघा गोरखपुर में अपने दादा कुबेर मौर्य, दादी द्रौपदी और चाचा साधु मौर्य की हत्या कर दी। घटना तब हुई जब दयाल ने एक भैंस पर एक फावड़े से हमला किया। जब उसके दादा ने हस्तक्षेप करने की कोशिश की, तो दयाल ने उसे घातक रूप से मारा, इसके बाद उसकी दादी और चाचा को मारा। स्थानीय लोगों ने दयाल को पकड़ लिया, जिसे घटनास्थल पर गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया। पुलिस ने हत्याओं में इस्तेमाल किया गया फावड़ा बरामद कर लिया और दयाल से पूछताछ कर रही है। <br>परिवार के HISTORY मानसिक स्वास्थ्य समस्याओं का है। कुबेर ने १९९० के दशक में मनोरोग सेवा प्राप्त की थी, और उनके बेटे मेवालाल, जो हाल ही में उत्पीड़न के लिए जेल से रिहा हुए थे, ने भी मानसिक स्वास्थ्य समस्याएं दिखाईं। हत्याओं से केवल दो दिन पहले, दयाल ने गाँव में एक तेज हथियार का प्रदर्शन किया, जिससे अलार्म बज गया। उसकी माँ ने कहा कि हाल की एक दुर्घटना के बाद से वह आक्रामक रूप से व्यवहार कर रहा था, तेज वस्तुओं को उठा रहा था और उन्हें खतरनाक ढंग से घुमा रहा था। शव परीक्षण और फोरेंसिक विश्लेषण जारी है। <br></p>
