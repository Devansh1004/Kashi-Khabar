	<meta name="description" content="The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) conducted searches in Lucknow, Azamgarh, Mau, and Ballia following the arrest of a 19-year-old man named Abdul Rehman in Faridabad for allegedly planning an attack on the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Rehman, an e-rickshaw driver, was found with two hand grenades and was in contact with radical elements linked to international terror outfits.  <br>The ATS focused on individuals with questionable credentials, verifying information received about their potential involvement in the plot, particularly regarding their email communications.  There was some resistance from locals during the searches in Ballia.  Rehman's family described him as a withdrawn young man who had been unwell since childhood.  Locals noticed a change in his behavior in recent months, including increased travel to Faizabad, Delhi, and Visakhapatnam. He was the sole breadwinner for his family, supporting his parents and three sisters. <br>">

				<h2>आतंकी साजिश विफल, राम मंदिर निशाने पर था।</h2>
				<p class="date">2025-03-04T19:39:00+00:00</p>
				<p class="summary">उत्तर प्रदेश एंटी टेररिस्ट स्क्वाड (एटीएस) ने फरीदाबाद में 19 वर्षीय अब्दुल रहमान की गिरफ्तारी के बाद आयोध्या में राम मंदिर पर हमले की योजना बनाने के आरोप में लखनऊ, आजमगढ़, मऊ और बलिया में छापेमारी की। रहमान, एक ई-रिक्शा चालक, के पास दो हैंड ग्रेनेड मिले और वह अंतरराष्ट्रीय आतंकवादी संगठनों से जुड़े कट्टरपंथी तत्वों के संपर्क में था। <br>एटीएस ने संदिग्ध पृष्ठभूमि वाले व्यक्तियों पर ध्यान केंद्रित किया, उनकी संभावित साजिश में शामिल होने के बारे में प्राप्त जानकारी की पुष्टि की, विशेष रूप से उनके ईमेल संचार के संबंध में। बलिया में छापेमारी के दौरान स्थानीय लोगों से कुछ प्रतिरोध हुआ। रहमान के परिवार ने उन्हें एक अंतर्मुखी युवक बताया जो बचपन से ही बीमार रहा था। स्थानीय लोगों ने हाल के महीनों में उनके व्यवहार में परिवर्तन देखा, जिसमें फैजाबाद, दिल्ली और विशाखापत्तनम की यात्रा में वृद्धि शामिल थी। वह अपने परिवार के लिए एकमात्र कमाने वाले थे, जिसमें उनके माता-पिता और तीन बहनें शामिल थीं।</p>
